All 3d models in this directory, `AbeHead`, are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).  Please use them without restriction.

Scans were done via [structured light David Scanner](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaign/3Dscanner/overview.html).

The scans were done in two sittings.  The first sitting was with the back of my head against a wall.  The second was with me laying face down and white paint in my
hair so that fine detail could be picked up.

The scans were aligned using the software provided by the David Scanner.  The textures are also included.

The scale should be metric, with one unit representing 1mm.

Original scans are provided along with the aligned and decimated versions of the model.
